2011 Mebipenny Competition
=======

The competition was broken into one practice round, and one online contest
round. For the top 13 people from the online contest, there was a final round.

In both the practice and contest folders, there is a folder per problem. Each
problem folder contains the problem description as a text file, and a README
containing a description of the correct solution, and common problems people
had.

Last, each problem folder also has all of the test cases we used. A test case
is a pair of stdin input and expected stdout output.
