See the_claw.txt for a problem description.

This problem is one in which many people think they intuitively grasp the best
approach where there is a subtle but better algorithm. All but one of the
solutions I saw implemented an O(n^2) algorithm, one guy even reimplementing his
interpreted language solution in C++ to try and gain speed.

However, you can do better. This problem can be solved in O(n log n).
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem

The only modification to the standard algorithm presented above is that you
simply don't consider point pairs that you are uninterested in, such as a pair
of goats or a pair of chickens. 4 of the 7 points for this problem were easily
gained if you implemented this faster algorithm.
