Cade is out with some friends and sees a particularly exciting claw-style game.
The game consists of a number of stuffed chickens and goats laid out in a grid
where Cade has the opportunity to control a hovering claw to try and grab one of
the stuffed farm animals.

A friend bets Cade that he can't get both a chicken and a goat in the same
attempt. Cade accepts the challenge, but needs your help. Cade needs to know
which chicken and goat pair is the closest together to best improve his chances.

You will receive C, C >= 1, the number of chickens, and G, G >= 1, the number of
goats, on the first line. You will then receive C lines consisting of a chicken
ID followed by integral X and Y coordinates, and then you will receive G lines
consisting of a goat ID followed by integral X and Y coordinates. Goat IDs and
chicken IDs will not overlap and will be globally unique.

Your output will be one line consisting of a chicken ID followed by a goat ID
that constitutes the closest pair of stuffed farm animals for Cade to try and
grab.
