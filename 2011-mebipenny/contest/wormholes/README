Please see wormhole.txt for the problem description.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm, given a graph, will compute single-source shortest
paths in a graph such as the one given to you in the problem description.
Notably, Bellman-Ford works on graphs with negative edge weights, presuming
there are no negative cycles. When Bellman-Ford detects a negative cycle, it
simply bails and cannot proceed.

Useful, no? All you have to do is implement Bellman-Ford, feed it the graph
given in the test case, and if Bellman-Ford bails due to a negative cycle, then
you found an arbitrary-length time-portal to the past.


UPDATE, 9/15: So, I've had a few reports of issues with this problem. Looks like
  slightly modifying and updating test problems the night before at 4 in the
  morning is a bad idea.

  Two issues with this problem:

  1) The paragraph about being able to reach every other galaxy from your
     starting was most definitely wrong, and many of the test cases explicitly
     checked to make sure you weren't assuming that. Whoops.
  2) I accidentally deleted a newline in one of the inputs. It's not exactly
     clear to me how my test program worked anyway. Still investigating.
