Suppose there are U universes.

Suppose each universe is filled with N galaxies, where N varies from universe to
universe, and connecting the galaxies are M wormholes, where M varies from
universe to universe. Wormholes are unidirectional and always connect two
different galaxies in the same universe.

Suppose further that traveling through a wormhole is instantaneous and travel
through a galaxy is negligible. Additionally, wormholes each have a specific
time differential associated, such that when you enter some wormholes, you exit
some amount of years in the future, but through others, you exit some amount of
years in the past.

Lastly, suppose that you can reach, from a starting galaxy, through some series
of wormhole jumps, every other galaxy in that universe, though it's not
necessarily the case that you can get back.

Given a universe description, is it possible to go an arbitrary amount of time
back into the past?

You will be given U universe descriptions. Each universe description consists
of one line containing N and M for that universe. Then M lines will follow,
each of the format A B T, where A is the source galaxy, B is the target galaxy,
and T is the time differential in years (positive means into the future,
negative means into the past). You can assume the starting galaxy is labeled
galaxy 1.

For each universe, you will need to output "Y" or "N".

Example:

STDIN:

1
5 6
1 2 15
2 5 12
3 2 20
5 3 -40
3 4 40
4 5 10

STDOUT:

Y
