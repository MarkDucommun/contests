Given a variable number of playing cards, form the best hand that does not
exceed 21. The cards are in the set [23456789JQKA], where 2-9 are worth their
face value, J Q and K are worth 10, and A can be selected to be worth either 1
and 11. In this scenario, you are only playing with one suit, so there is never
more than one of each card.

Input:

The first line is a single number, which is the number of lines to follow. Each
line after that is a sequence of characters in the above set.

Output:

For each input line of cards, output the highest possible score that does not
exceed 21.

Example:

STDIN:

4
296J
85
A37
475A

STDOUT:

21
