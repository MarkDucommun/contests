Please see permute.txt for the problem description.

This problem was not the best stated of our problem set this year. Luckily it
was only a practice problem.

The general problem, restated, is, given a set of numbers in any order, a set of
binary operations in any order (which are not necessarily commutative), and a
target result, can you use those numbers and binary operations in some arbitrary
ordering to generate the target result?

A straightforward solution is to simply generate all the postfix-notation
variations of combinations of permutations of the given numbers, evaluate them,
and stop if you find one that generates the target result.

Common problems with provided solutions often centered around not actually
considering all orderings of the provided numbers, in addition to all the
possible orderings (and commutativity) of the operators.
