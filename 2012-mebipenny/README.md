2012 Mebipenny Competition
=======

The competition was broken into one practice round, and one online
contest round. For the top 12 people from the online contest, there was
a final round.

This years practice round just used last years problems, so there is no
practice folder. If you want to see those problems, look in
2011-mebipenny/practice/.

In the contest folder, there is a folder per problem. Each problem
folder contains the problem title, description, an example solution, and
a set of test cases for the problem. A test case is a pair of stdin
input and expected stdout output.

A small number of problems had incorrect test cases during the
competition; we've corrected the test cases in this commit, but noted
which test cases had been incorrect in the "notes.txt" files.

The finals round is in finals/; see its README.md for details.
