<p>A standard US telephone keypad has letters on most of the numbers, to be
used as a mnemonic aid in memorizing a phone number. Each letter is represented
by a specific number, as follows:</p>

<pre>
2 = ABC
3 = DEF
4 = GHI
5 = JKL
6 = MNO
7 = PQRS
8 = TUV
9 = WXYZ
</pre>

<p>Write a program to convert any phone number to its pure-numeric form.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The input to your program will consist of multiple lines of phone numbers,
consisting only of upper/lowercase letters and numbers.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each line of input, output the numeric form on a single line. Do not
include any punctuation. Each line will contain no more than 63 characters.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
