<p>Your former co-worker has left your company to work at a distributed storage
startup. He has decided to serialize all messages between systems using an
implementation of morse code as follows:</p>

<pre>
A ._            N _.
B _...          O ___
C _._.          P .__.
D _..           Q __._
E .             R ._.
F .._.          S ...
G __.           T _
H ....          U .._
I ..            V ..._
J .___          W .__
K _._           X _.._
L ._..          Y _.__
M __            Z __..
</pre>

<p>For example, ".__..__._..._" is the word "PANDA". Unfortunately, this
sequence also spells 'ADGBT', 'PAKV', 'WUNBT', 'WUNNIT', 'WUNNU', etc., along
with many others. To solve this problem, your friend asks you to find a
solution while he works on developing his own programming language.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The input will be a string of morse code.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>As output, print all of the possible translations, separated by new lines,
in alphabetical order.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>STDIN:</p>

<pre>
.__..__._..._
</pre>

<p>STDOUT:</p>

<pre>
ADGBT
ADGDA
ADGDET
ADGNEA
ADGNEET
...
WUTLET
WUTREA
WUTREET
WUTRIT
WUTRU
