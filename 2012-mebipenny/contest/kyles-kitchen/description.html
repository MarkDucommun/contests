<p>Kyle is refinishing his rectangular kitchen and would like to use a
variety of tetromino-shaped tiles. With the miscellaneous tetromino
tiles he has, he recognizes that it may be difficult, if not impossible,
to perfectly cover his kitchen floor. However, he'd still like to spend
a minimal amount of time making up other tiles to fill in holes.</p>

<p>There are 5 standard tetrominoes, which you may recognize from a
popular falling pieces puzzle game. Kyle has decided to label the types
of tiles:</p>

<pre>
A: XXXX   C: XX   E: X
             XX      XX
                     X
B: X      D: X
   X         XX
   XX         X
</pre>

<p>His tiles are such that it doesn't matter if you flip them over or
rotate them; the tiles will still look good on his N foot by M foot
floor. For scale, the A tetromino is 1 foot by 4 feet. Rotation should
only happen by increments of 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Kyle wants to know, given N, M, and a set of tiles, what is the maximum
number of his tiles he can fit on his kitchen floor.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line of input will be two integers N and M, the dimensions
of the floor. The second line will be a space separated list of all of
the tiles Kyle has.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Your output will be the maximum number of tiles Kyle can fit on his
floor.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>STDIN:</p>

<pre>
4 4
C C B E
</pre>

<p>STDOUT:</p>

<pre>
3
</pre>
