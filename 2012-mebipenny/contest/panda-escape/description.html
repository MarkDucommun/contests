<p>There once was a land filled with rainbows and pandas, working their bamboo
farms and trading skittles with their unicorn neighbors. The land was ruled by
the Panda Emperor, a kind and benevolent leader who was dearly loved.</p>

<p>The Emperor fell in love and married a commoner, but his most trusted
general &mdash; El Generalissimo &mdash; did not approve. One night he took over the
kingdom and locked the Panda Emperor in the deepest dungeon.</p>

<p>After the Emperor was captured, the Emperor's most trusted guards found the
Empress and led her through a secret escape route into the forest. As they fled
the traitor's troops, they reached a clearing atop a huge chasm and could go no
further. In the clearing stood a small cottage from whose open door a man with
a strange hat stepped into view.</p>

<p>"Need to cross?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Please, is there anything you can do?" the Empress pled.</p>

<p>The man smiled, closed his eyes, and wiggled his nose. A cloud formed at the
edge of the chasm. The man spoke: "This cloud can carry exactly N pounds&mdash;no
less, no more."</p>

<p>"Why no less? That doesn't even make sense!" growled the Captain of the
Guard.</p>

<p>"It doesn't have to make sense, it just needs to make this problem more
interesting," said the old man.</p>

<p>There was no time to argue...</p>

<p>Write a program to determine which guards should accompany the Empress.
Solutions should maximize the number of guards accompanying her. If there are
multiple solutions with the same number of guards, use the weight of the
heaviest included guard as the tie breaker (or second-heaviest if the heaviest
is tied, etc.). For example, between a solution of (150, 175, 200) and (150,
160, 215), prefer the latter.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>Each line of input will consist of two or more integers. The first is the
capacity of the cloud. The second is the weight of the Empress. The remainder
are the weights of the guards. There may be up to 256 guards, the weights of
the guards and Empress are each in the range [1, 255], and the max weight is at
most 32767.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each line of input, output the optimal list of guards which will
accompany the Empress, in order from lightest to heaviest. If there is no
solution, output "NO SOLUTION".</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>STDIN:</p>

<pre>
800 200 200 400 210 300 190
300 300 100
300 200 80 60 20 40
200 210 80 120
</pre>

<p>STDOUT:</p>

<pre>
190 200 210

20 80
NO SOLUTION
