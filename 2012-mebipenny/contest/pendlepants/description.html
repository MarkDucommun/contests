<p>Your friend, Zoo Ossped, was driving through Pendleton, Oregon and bought a
pair of yellow hipster jeans (pendlepants) from a thrift store. They were such
a big hit with his wife and co-workers he bought 3 more (turquoise, red, and
peanut-butter).</p>

<p>Later that month, Zoo took a trip to Seattle with his pendlepants and
converted 10-speed to ride in a fixie parade. Dissilusioned, Zoo realized that
he didn't measure up to the real hipsters in Seattle with just his pendlepants.
These mustached hipsters paired their hipster jeans with commensurate hipster
tank tops.</p>

<p>Of course, Zoo bought several before the sun could set on the space needle.
While he was at it, he bought a few hipster frames to claim his spot in hipster
history.</p>

<p>Given a wardrobe, print the unique outfits Zoo Ossped can put together
when he gets home.</p>
