<p>Like many math-wielding civilizations, the ancient Egyptians had a need to
represent fractional values. Their representation of fractions was similar to
our current system, with one limitation: the numerator (top part) of the
fraction is always 1. That is, they could only write fractions like these:</p>

<pre>
1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, ...
</pre>

<p>Any other fractional amount was represented as the sum of these simple
fractions. Note that in the Egyptian fraction system, each denominator can only
be used once.</p>

<pre>
3/5 = 1/2 + 1/10  (NOT 1/5 + 1/5 + 1/5)
</pre>

<p>Any modern fraction with a positive integral numerator and denominator can
be represented in the Egyptian style. Your task is to write a program that
accepts a "modern" fraction and outputs the Egyptian representation. Note that
there may be mulitple valid representations. (Example: 1/2 could be written
"1/3 + 1/6"). Your program should always use the largest unit possible, and
display the components in descending order. Example:</p>

<pre>
4/7 = 1/2 + 1/14              (CORRECT)
4/7 = 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/14        (INCORRECT)

3/4 = 1/2 + 1/4               (CORRECT)
3/4 = 1/4 + 1/2               (INCORRECT)
3/4 = 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/20        (INCORRECT)
3/4 = 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/20  (INCORRECT)
</pre>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>Each line of input will be two positive non-zero integers, the first less
than or equal to the second, representing a fraction in (0, 1].</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each input, print a line with the Egyptian denominators in ascending
order.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>STDIN:</p>

<pre>
3 5
5 7
5 13
</pre>

<p>STDOUT:</p>

<pre>
2 10
2 5 70
3 20 780
</pre>
