<p>Greg is a loyal fan of the local Sportsball team, the Salt Lake Oddballs.
The Oddballs have had a pretty wild season, winning and losing games by huge
margins. They qualified for this year's World Bowl, but Greg is a bit nervous
given their inconsistent performance all season.</p>

<p>"Don't sweat it," says Greg's friend JT. "The Oddballs are guaranteed to win
the Trophy Cup this year. I've found a pattern in their stats, and it's a sure
thing."</p>

<p>Greg is skeptical, but like all true sports fans is also a bit
superstitious. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Okay, so here's the deal. It doesn't matter how well they do in the season,
it's all about streaks of games with odd point margins," JT said, waving his
hands enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"So you look at those consecutive games with odd margins, and find the run
of games that has the largest total point differential. If the number of games
is odd, the Oddballs will win the World Bowl. If it's even, they either lose or
don't even qualify. I've run the numbers all the way back to '83 and it totally
holds up."</p>

<p>"Hmm..."</p>

<p>"Ok, so take this season. In the last 10 games, the point margins were 16,
-3, -2, -4 -1, 5, 23, -1, 11 and 1. The last 5 games happen to be their best
odd margin streak this season, for a total of 39 points. Since the number of
games is odd, that means they're going to win this year."</p>

<p>Greg is not quite convinced, but wants to see if the Oddball Rule really
does hold up historically. The Oddballs have won all 11 of their World Bowl
appearances, so JT may be onto something.</p>

<p>Given lists of positive and negative integers, output the largest sum of
consecutive odd integers in each list.</p>
