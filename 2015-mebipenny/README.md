2015 Mebipenny Competition
=======

The competition was broken into a week long practice round, and one online
contest round. For the top 10 people from the online contest from each of Salt
Lake City and Chicago, there was a final round.

This years practice round used the previous years' problems, so there is no
practice folder. If you want to see those problems, look in
2011-mebipenny/ and 2012-mebipenny/.

In the first-round folder, there is a folder per problem. Each problem
folder contains the problem title, description, debug test cases, and
graded test cases for the problem. A test case is a pair of stdin
input and expected stdout output.

The finals round is in finals/; see its README.md for details.
