<h1>It's Totally Better Than Chess</h1>
<p>Go is an amazing game of strategy and cunning where players
take turns placing colored stones on a board to try to surround more territory
than their opponent.</p>
<p>Playing it is really fun. Scoring it is really tedious.</p>
<p>Build a program that can take the serialized state of
a Go board and output the final score according to the following rules:</p>
<p>1) A space with a stone on it is not worth any points.<br />
2) spaces are contiguous if they are related horizontally or vertically (not diagonally)<br />
3) Each cell of space inside a contiguous region of spaces surrounded by a single<br />
color of stones is worth one point for that color. (being against a wall is the same<br />
 as being surrounded)<br />
4) Each cell of space that is in a contiguous regions of spaces that is touched by<br />
both black and white stones is neutral, and worth points for neither player.<br />
5) Boards are not bounded, but will always be a square (3x3, 5x5, 6x6, 9x9, 25x25, etc)<br />
6) Each row of input is a row on the board.<br />
7) Each cell is delimited by spaces<br />
8) B = a black stone, W = a white stone, _ = an empty space</p>
<p>Sample input:</p>
<pre><code>B _ _ _
B B B B
W W W W
W _ _ W</code></pre>
<p>Sample output (black is always listed first):</p>
<pre><code>Black: 3
White: 2</code></pre>
<p>Automate the scoring, and you can spend more time playing!</p>
