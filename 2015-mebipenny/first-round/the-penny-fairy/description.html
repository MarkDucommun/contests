<h1>The Penny Fairy</h1>
<p>Your friend JT has a problem. Every morning when he unlocks his car, he
finds new pennies in his cupholder and ketchup packets scattered
everywhere. He's not sure who's putting them there or how they're doing
it -- only he has a key -- but that's not actually what he's worried
about. JT is concerned that eventually he won't be able to fit his Soylent
travel mug in the cupholder.</p>

<p>He's started tallying how many pennies are left every night, and has
discovered that it depends on how many were there before; it grows by
a constant factor. This growth rate may not be an integer, but the number
of pennies always will be (rounding up when necessary), e.g.
18 -&gt; 27 -&gt; 41 -&gt; 62 ...</p>

<p>JT has also calculated how many pennies can go in the cupholder before
the mug won't fit. He just needs to figure out how long he can safely wait
before removing the pennies.</p>

<p>Given the penny count from yesterday, the penny count from today, and a
maximum penny capacity, calculate the minimum number of days it will
take the penny population to meet or exceed the capacity.</p>
