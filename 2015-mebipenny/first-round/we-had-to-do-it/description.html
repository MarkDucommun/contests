<h1>We Had to Do It</h1>
<p>It's widely known that there are many &quot;programmers&quot; out there who are
CHARLATANS and who don't actually know how to write code. By legend,
FizzBuzz is the problem that can seperate the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to [x].<br />
For multiples of [y] print “Fizz” instead of the number.<br />
For multiples of [z] print “Buzz”.<br />
For numbers which are multiples of both [y] and [z] print “FizzBuzz”.<br />
Line 1 of input is an integer [x]<br />
Line 2 of input is an integer [y]<br />
Line 3 of input is an integer [z]<br />
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>STDIN:</p>

<pre><code>20
3
5</code></pre>

<p>STDOUT:</p>
<pre><code>1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17

19

<p>Be you programmer or be you imposter?</p>
